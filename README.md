# mandelb0t
Twitter bot that generates an image of the Mandelbrot set and posts it to the Twitters!

I built this real quick one day for fun and to make use of some new libraries and play around with images.

To run it yourself, install the dependencies and then fill out the settings with your own api access keys.

Dependencies
- tweepy
- PIL
